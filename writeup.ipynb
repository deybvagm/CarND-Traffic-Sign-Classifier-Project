    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?. The problem with the architecture was that the accuracy did not get the expected results\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting. The first thing I did was to change the optimization algorithm to `Adam Optimizer`. I made this decision because this optimizer is more robust than Gradient Descent. Next, I wanted to see of the model could be improved by feeding in it grayscale images instead of RGB images and indeed, the model accuracy was improved. Then I trained the model and realized an overfitting problem, where the training accuracy was high but the validation accuracy low. In that point I decided to use regularization techniques such as Dropout (in fully connected layers) and L2 regularization as well as use data augmentation techniques to reduce overfitting. The gap between train and validation accuracy was reduced by these techniques but at a cost: train and validation accuracy were almost the same, 92% and it was difficult to get a better performance with a beta value for L2 regularization of 0.01. So after data augmentation which improved performance I decided to train only with either L2 regularion or Dropout and I found that the model only with Dropout has a good accuracy on both training and validation (0.99 and 0.96 respectively)\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?. I tuned the `learning_rate` as well as the `dropout`. I found that the better value for learning rate that made possible the convergence of the algorithm was `0.001`. I tried with values `0.1, 0.01, 0.5 and 0.0001`. I also tuned the `keep_prob` hyperparameter with values ranging `from 0.5 to 0.8`. I found that the best value was `0.6`.\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?. This kind of model is important because translation invariance, where the traffic sign can appear in different positions in the image. Other important thing is that the model learn to recognize shapes despite of light conditions. Regularization techniques are useful because they reduce overfitting and made the model to generalize better to new data. Also by generating fake data, the algorithm gets a better performance\n",

    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen. The LENET architeture proposed in course was chosen\n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?. It is relevant because the model learn to recognize traffic signs with high confidence\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?. There is evidence that the model performs well because the gap between training, validation and test accuracy is low\n"
